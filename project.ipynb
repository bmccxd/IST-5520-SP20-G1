    "## Introduction\n",
    "Traffic crashes happened every day in the world and they rank as the 9th leading cause of death. Taking U.S. as an example, on average, there are 16,438 car crashes per day in the US and nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes per year, by this we mean that, car accidents cause 3,287 deaths per day. Therefore, it is important for us to get more information about car crashes and try to avoid them.\n",
    "We found a dataset of car crashes in the Vermont state from the year 2014 to 2018. We are considering the dataset from the perspective of an insurer using telematics devices in vehicles to create individualized risk profiles for insureds located in Vermont and set their premiums accordingly. We are interested in determining what kinds of characteristics are responsible for vehicle accidents and how to use this information to adjust an insured's future premium once they are in an accident. To be more specific, we want to figure out what matters the most in the accidents. Also, we hope to find out factors that lead to various outcomes (property damage, injury or fatal). Besides, we want to find out areas or roads that are most prone to accidents."

    "## Data Source and Collection\n",
    "The data source is a set of 10,000 car accidents in Vermont from taken from the Vermont Open Geodata Portal. The data was collected by various reporting agencies within Vermont. Some key information in the dataset includes the type of injury, the impairment of the driver, the accident location, weather, the road conditions, as well as the reporting agency. All of this information can be useful in determining how the insured's future premiums will be adjusted."
