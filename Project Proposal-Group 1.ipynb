    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic crashes happen every day in the world and they rank as the 9th leading cause of death. In the United States, there are an average of 16,438 car accidents per day. Moreover, nearly 1.25 million people die in car accidents per year, by this we mean that, car accidents cause 3,287 deaths per day. ï¼ˆhttps://www.thewanderingrv.com/car-accident-statistics/) Therefore, it is important for us to get more information about car crashes and try to avoid them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a dataset of car crashes in the State of Vermont from the year 2014 to 2018. We are considering the dataset from the perspective of an insurance company using telematics devices in vehicles to create individualized risk profiles for policyholders located in Vermont and set their premiums accordingly. We are interested in determining what kinds of characteristics are responsible for vehicle accidents and how to use this information to adjust a policyholder's future premium once they are in an accident. To be more specific, we want to figure out what matters the most in the accidents. Also, we hope to find out factors that lead to various outcomes (property damage, injury or fatal). In addition, we want to find out areas or roads that are most prone to accidents."
